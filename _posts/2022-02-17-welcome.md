Hello!

I am Lucia and I develop software.

I graduated from NYU Tandon School of Engineering in January 2022, with a major in CS and minor in Math. While in NYU, I was part of an exchange student program with Yonsei University in Seoul, Korea.

Currently, Iâ€™m working as a developer at a platform startup in Korea, focusing on our own AI model, backend code, data crawling, and etc. I'm also working as a PM at LognCoding.

If you want to reach out to me, always feel free to contact me via [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luciajeon/) or email me at <span style="color: #90a959"> luciaajeon@gmail.com</span>.
