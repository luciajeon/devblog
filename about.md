Hello!

I graduated from NYU Tandon School of Engineering in January 2022, with a major in CS and minor in Math.

Currently, I'm a main developer at a platform startup in Korea.

I'm looking forward to strengthen my entry-level AI / ML understanding as a software engineer.

Feel free to reach out to me via Linkedin :)
